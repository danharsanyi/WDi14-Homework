        <h2>The Art of Computer Programming</h2>

        <p class="artOf">By understanding a machine-oriented language, the programmer will tend to use a much more efficient method; it is much closer to reality.</p>
        <i class="fa fa-quote-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>

        <i class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        <h2>Computer Programming as an Art</h2>

        <p class="asAn">Science is knowledge which we understand so well that we can teach it to a computer; and if we don't fully understand something, it is an art to deal with it. ... In this sense, we should continually be striving to transform every art into a science: in the process, we advance the art.</p>
        <p class="as">.</p>
        <p class="as">.</p>
        <p class="as">.</p>
        <p class="asAn">The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming.</p>
        <i class="fa fa-quote-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>

        <i class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        <h2>Literate Programming</h2>

        <p class="literate">Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.</p>
