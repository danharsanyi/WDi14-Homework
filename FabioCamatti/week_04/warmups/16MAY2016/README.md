# 99 Bottles of Beer

Write a program which prints out the lyrics to that beloved classic, that field-trip favorite: _99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall._

## Requirements

* The program should be called with `Beer.song`
* The program should output text to the console
* Each verse should be separated by a single blank line.

## Extensions

* Make the type of beer customizable
* Allow the following function calls to work:
  - ` Beer.song() ` - That should do the whole song
  - ` Beer.song(45) ` - This should do from 45 down
  - ` Beer.song(34, 12) ` - This should print from 34 to 12

## Data

Here's a sampling of the lyrics...

```
99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.

98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.

97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the wall.
```

Then, at the end...

```
1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
Take it down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.

No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.
Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
```
