# Specification:
#
# A user should be given a menu of operations
# A user should be able to choose from the menu
# A user should be able to enter numbers to perform the operation on
# A user should be shown the result
# This process should continue until the user selects a quit option from the menu

# we create a method called menu that prints out a bunch of information. This means
#we can call it lots of times
