After enrolling in ISIPCA, the international school of perfumery in Versailles Francis went on to create Le Male, the first men's fragrance by Jean Paul Gaultier in 1993. After 19 years of lending his nose to many such houses he opened up his own boutique perfumery in Paris and Maison Francis Kurkdjian was born.", :image => "http://www.franciskurkdjian.com/cache/images/folder/fa9052653122c67d49c66eb3605dc66c-mfk-portraitfk-hd-96.jpg"

The perfume arrives after women’s fragrance Feminin Pluriel which also includes roses framed in flowers of iris, violet, jasmine and lily of the valley. The composition of the new fragrance is inspired by Marie Antoinette’s love of roses and a portrait of Marie Antoinette A La Rose painted by Louise Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun, in which she is holding a rose in her hand. Maison Francis Kurkdjian A La Rose is composed of two sorts of roses, Damascus rose and Turkish rose absolute, carefully refreshed with a citrusy blend of bergamot, orange and lemon in top notes. Powdery floral notes are combined with a bouquet of roses and velvety violets, while base notes provide character to woody notes of cedar.", :image => "https://fimgs.net/images/perfume/nd.29083.jpg"

This is a perfect light rose fragrance, not a heavy musk oriental rose like most of the big contenders on the market. Only downside is due to it being so light you chew through the bottle so quickly, which makes this a very expensive venture!"
