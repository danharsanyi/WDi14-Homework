          <h2>A little about Jenn</h2>
          <p>Jen Schiffer is a web developer who lives in New Jersey on purpose and works full-time as an open web engineer at Bocoup. When she's not building open web apps with the coolest web developers and clients in the game, she's making art with code, telling jokes, and getting yelled at on the Internet.</p>

          <p>In a past life, Jenn was a senior front-end developer at the NBA and, before that, taught and evaluated computer science education at Montclair State University – where she got her BS and MS in Computer Science. She's the organizer of JerseyScript, a front-end developer meetup based in New Jersey – one of several ventures she's involved in to attract and retain more people in the web development community.</p>

          <p>Lately Jenn has been focusing on making tools to teach and facilitate the creation and knowledge of art and code, speaking about and teaching web development all over the place, and trying to help her peers take themselves a little less seriously.</p>
